ABSTRACT = {The quantification of plantar pressure distribution is widely done in the diagnosis of lower limbs deformities, gait analysis, footwear design, and sport applications. To date, a number of pressure insole layouts have been proposed, with different configurations according to their applications. The goal of this study is to assess the validity of a 16-sensors (1.5 × 1.5 cm) pressure insole to detect plantar pressure distribution during different tasks in the clinic and sport domains. The data of 39 healthy adults, acquired with a Pedar-X® system (Novel GmbH, Munich, Germany) during walking, weight lifting, and drop landing, were used to simulate the insole. The sensors were distributed by considering the location of the peak pressure on all trials: 4 on the hindfoot, 3 on the midfoot, and 9 on the forefoot. The following variables were computed with both systems and compared by estimating the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): Peak/Mean Pressure, Ground Reaction Force (GRF), Center of Pressure (COP), the distance between COP and the origin, the Contact Area. The lowest (0.61%) and highest (82.4%) RMSE values were detected during gait on the medial-lateral COP and the GRF, respectively. This approach could be used for testing different layouts on various applications prior to production.},

ABSTRACT = {Wearable technologies are emerging as a useful tool with many different applications. While these devices are worn on the human body and can capture numerous data types, this literature review focuses specifically on wearable use for performance enhancement and risk assessment in industrial- and sports-related biomechanical applications. Wearable devices such as exoskeletons, inertial measurement units (IMUs), force sensors, and surface electromyography (EMG) were identified as key technologies that can be used to aid health and safety professionals, ergonomists, and human factors practitioners improve user performance and monitor risk. IMU-based solutions were the most used wearable types in both sectors. Industry largely used biomechanical wearables to assess tasks and risks wholistically, which sports often considered the individual components of movement and performance. Availability, cost, and adoption remain common limitation issues across both sports and industrial applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have reduced drastically in size, cost, and power consumption, while improving accuracy. The combination of different sensor technologies is considered a promising step in the monitoring of athletes. Those “wearables” enable the capturing of relevant physiological and tactical information in individual and team sports and thus replacing subjective, time-consuming and qualitative methods with objective, quantitative ones. Prior studies mainly comprised sports categories such as: targeting sports, batting and fielding games as well as net and wall games, focusing on the detection of individual, non-locomotive movements. The increasing capabilities of wearables allow for more complex and integrative analysis expanding research into the last category: invasion sports. Such holistic approaches allow the derivation of metrics, estimation of physical conditions and the analysis of team strategic behavior, accompanied by integrative knowledge gains in technical, tactical, physical, and mental aspects of a sport. However, prior and current researchers find the precise measurement of the actual movement within highly dynamic and non-linear movement difficult. Thus, the present article showcases an overview of the environments in which the wearables are employed. It elaborates their use in individual as well as team-related performance analyses with a special focus on reliability and validity, challenges, and future directions.},

ABSTRACT = {Wearable technologies have become increasingly popular in recent years, as athletes and coaches look for ways to gain a competitive edge. These devices can track a variety of metrics, including heart rate, sleep quality, and movement patterns. This information can be used to identify areas for improvement and make small, incremental changes that can lead to significant gains in performance. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide an integrative overview of the literature on the impact of wearable technologies on marginal gains in sports performance. The literature review was conducted using the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases, and a total of 55 papers were considered eligible. The results of the literature overview suggest that wearable devices can be classified into three main categories. (1) Location-based wearables (LBW) track an athlete’s location and movement, which can be used to analyze training patterns and identify potential injury risks. (2) Biometric wearables (BMW) track physiological data such as heart rate, sleep quality, and body temperature; these data can be used to monitor an athlete’s fitness levels and identify signs of overtraining. (3) Performance wearables (PMW) track performance metrics such as power output, speed, and distance; this information can be used to optimize training programs and track progress over time. For each category, this paper provides the five most important data points measured by each suggested device. Additionally, sport-specific examples are provided for each category based on the literature data. The limitations of wearable devices, such as accuracy, validity, reliability, interpretability, and cost, are also discussed. However, despite these limitations, the results of the literature review suggest that wearable technologies can be a valuable tool for athletes and coaches who are looking to improve performance. Ultimately, this technological evolution in sports science is likely to dramatically change the state of the art in athletic monitoring and sports analytics.},

ABSTRACT = {The present paper reviews, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the most recent advances in research concerning two popular devices used for foot motion analysis and health monitoring: smart socks and in-shoe systems. The first one is representative of textile-based systems, whereas the second one is one of the most used pressure sensitive insole (PSI) systems that is used as an alternative to smart socks. The proposed methods are reviewed for smart sock use in special medical applications, for gait and foot pressure analysis. The Pedar system is also shown, together with studies of validation and repeatability for Pedar and other in-shoe systems. Then, the applications of Pedar are presented, mainly in medicine and sports. Our purpose was to offer the researchers in this field a useful means to overview and select relevant information. Moreover, our review can be a starting point for new, relevant research towards improving the design and functionality of the systems, as well as extending the research towards other areas of applications using sensors in smart textiles and in-shoe systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Impaired walking increases injury risk during locomotion, including falls-related acute injuries and overuse damage to lower limb joints. Gait impairments seriously restrict voluntary, habitual engagement in injury prevention activities, such as recreational walking and exercise. There is, therefore, an urgent need for technology-based interventions for gait disorders that are cost effective, willingly taken-up, and provide immediate positive effects on walking. Gait control using shoe-insoles has potential as an effective population-based intervention, and new sensor technologies will enhance the effectiveness of these devices. Shoe-insole modifications include: (i) ankle joint support for falls prevention; (ii) shock absorption by utilising lower-resilience materials at the heel; (iii) improving reaction speed by stimulating cutaneous receptors; and (iv) preserving dynamic balance via foot centre of pressure control. Using sensor technology, such as in-shoe pressure measurement and motion capture systems, gait can be precisely monitored, allowing us to visualise how shoe-insoles change walking patterns. In addition, in-shoe systems, such as pressure monitoring and inertial sensors, can be incorporated into the insole to monitor gait in real-time. Inertial sensors coupled with in-shoe foot pressure sensors and global positioning systems (GPS) could be used to monitor spatiotemporal parameters in real-time. Real-time, online data management will enable ‘big-data’ applications to everyday gait control characteristics.},

Basketball, as one of the most popular sports in the world, has millions of followers and massive economic value. Basketball evolves so fast that it requires teams with smarter strategies, better skills, and stronger players. However, the competition strategies and training methods in basketball are still experience-based, lacking precise data to drive for more efficient training and strategies. On the other hand, flexible sensors, as a new class of sensors, have been a hotspot for scientific research and widely applied in various fields. Due to their excellent characteristics of flexibility, wearing comfort, convenience, and response speed, integrating flexible sensors into basketball has the potential to greatly promote all aspects of the sport. This paper aims to bring more fusion between basketball and flexible sensors. In this perspective, we first perform a review of the history of sensing technologies in the basketball sport and discuss mechanisms of flexible sensors applied on basketball players. Then specific scenarios for flexible sensors applied in basketball were elaborated on in detail. Finally, we envision the potential applications of flexible sensors in basketball and present our views on future development directions. We hope this paper can depict how flexible sensing technology is integrated into basketball systems and point out the future development of basketball with the help of flexible sensors.}
